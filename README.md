Project: Product Listing Page

Scenario:
You are tasked with creating a product listing page for Liberty's website. The page should display a list of products, each with their name, price, image, any variants (colour / size), and a "Add to Bag" button. Consider SEO, accessibility and performance for this build.

Requirements:

Design:
You can use any libertylondon.com Product Listing Page for insipration. You can either copy exactly or put your own spin on it. 

HTML:

- Create an HTML file with the basic structure of the page. (Header and Footer is optional)
- Display at least 6 products in a grid layout.
- Each product should have a name, price, image and any varients (colour / size).
- Include a button (styled as you see fit) labeled "Add to Bag" for each product.

CSS:

- Style the product listing page to give it an elegant and luxury feel.
- Apply responsive design techniques to ensure the page looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Can use Bootstrap Framework.

JavaScript:

- Add functionality to the "Add to Bag" buttons so that when clicked, a message appears indicating that the product has been added to the bag.

You don't need to implement an actual shopping bag; a simple alert or message will suffice.

Bonus (Optional):

- Implement a hover effect on the products to highlight them.
- Use CSS animations or transitions to enhance user interactions.

Submission:

Please provide the following:

- The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the project.
- Any additional assets required to run the project. Images can be taken from libertylondon.com. Fonts will be provided.
- A brief explanation of your decisions and any challenges you faced during the development process.
